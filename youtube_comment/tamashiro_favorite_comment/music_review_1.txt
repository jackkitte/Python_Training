Italian operatic styles, air of marching tune, japanese styling.
Yep, I'm sold.

Hate to break it to you GanShinRecords, Angela's new album is NOT available 
in the USA. It is nowhere to be found on the itunes store and cannot be 
purchased.
Love the opening, but i cant help doing the Tim Allen grunt when the wolfie 
looks toward the camera
Essa musica sempre ARREPIA! <3
Justiceuuduuu!!!

Why do I feel like this is humanity's anthem in Attack on Titan??
Music sounds good, but the video was a disaster
Tsumugi is best girl

Creo que este es el mejor opening 2015 una cancion excelente para el anime

Woodkid?
This should be done for a long while ago, finally angela has done this 
awesome music show!
love the show knights of Sidonia
the manga had the worst ending I've ever seen :( not looking forward for a 
third season anymore...
Connichi 2015 Kassel Germany, great show
whats the anime used for this song?
half of the mv is look like , Woodkid "iron". could it called inspiration? 
or ... ???
DRAMATIC HUSKY STARES!!!
if this was a national anthem of a country, I'd apply citizenship there. 
that's how patriotic this song is.
Perfect Grade Strike Gundam :3

Best anime series I have ever watched, I prey for more lol. And the opening 
songs were pretty catchy as well. I prefer the first season opening more 
though, but still a great song
Season one was freaking awesome but season two was a bit of a let down. I 
think season three is gonna kick ass because they're FINALLY gonna fight 
the giant freaking gauna
My favorite simply because its mostly orchestral.
This looks kind of weird....
The only thing I liked in this video is the cute army of wolves that I wish 
I could cuddle >///<
She is so tiny in waist and height in real life lol
All the dislikes came from the Gauna
So many good songs out there and this ranks right at the top along with 
season 1. I can't wait until there's a season 3!
The itunes link sentr me to a German itunes.
Best sci-fi mech anime since super dimensional fortress Macross.
It doesn't really matter how good or bad the song is, you can just tell 
that the percussionist had a butt-load of fun making this video.
GUILTY PLEASURE!!!
Elegant! I loved lt!... Can't wait for 3‹ Season
‚±‚±‚Å•KŽE‚Ìƒƒ“ƒRô
I really do like the idea that once the planet is terraformed, the garden 
are just going to become ancient, rusted pieces of the land scape
I really. REALLY. Want that flag.
i loved this anime it was something different i loved attack on titan also 
and sword art online S.A.O sparked my interest in virtual reality since 
it's based on a vrmmorpg
Who's the guy on the drums/keyboard? Is- Is that Asian David Bowie?
Aaaand downloaded.
QUE BUENA CANCION Y SOBRE TODO EL TEMA PERFECTO PARA UN ANIME MUY BUENO :)
fucking love this song
there really needs to be a season 3 because there is tons of shiz happening 
but I'm still pissed about hoshijiro's death
Excelente video.
Angela 

J'adore toutes ses chansons de OP et ED qu'elle chante dans anime. (^o^
ƒMƒ^[‚â‚ç‘¾ŒÛ’@‚¢‚Ä‚él—v‚ç‚È‚¢‚æ‚Ëw
This really grew on my throughout the series, now one of my favorite anime 
songs. Hard to decided but I think I like this slightly better than her 
season 1 song. I love how parts of it sound like a military march of sorts, 
like it could be played along with Stars and Strips Forever, then they 
twist in some techno portions. Another favorite of mine is the Claymore 
anime ending song Danzai no Hana and also its opening song Raison d'tre 
(if you like a little more metal anyhow) those are probably my most fav.
Vaya himno!!
Blame! is better, ANIME WHEN?
awesome dogs! Everything else is irrelevant.
Does anyone else think about Woodkid's video of Iron watching this?
i wish i had a wolve like one of these maybe go hunting with it cx 
am i the only one that this song kinda remind you of attack on titan?
where can i find this track
Angela is the best anime musician, on her concerts she sings all the best 
anime songs. And as sci-fi fan she also does all sci-fi anime so im a great 
fan,,,, otaku mode off now :D
I do like the idea that after they terraformed the planet and beat the 
gauna, the mechs just became part of the landscaped.
This song is AWESOME! So catchy!
2:00 and 3:44 How...the hell am I suppose to pronounce that?
One of the best anime openings I've ever seen.
I like how they make the openings of the anime in a war hymn fashion
Robot sound was better
cant seem to find a full version of the 1st OP song from season 1, some guy 
posted a link but it's in jap, cant translate to get to set it to HD
thank god...i can download this video before get banned :V
I can't wait to see season 3 does eny one know when its out ?
Excelente me encanto sobre todo los mecha al rededor del planeta EPICO!
Hey guys!
I just made an 8-bit remix of this song on my channel. I would really 
appreciate it you could check it out and give me some feedback on it! ^-^
Thanks!
I love how both of Angela's song of Knights of Sidonia has a 
militaristic-like parts in it, then it goes Techno, it's so catchy!
Would make a nice national anthem for a new country....
One of the best shows I have seen in recent years, just needed better 
pacing though.
how does post apocalyptic scifi became Harem?
Katsu is gettings his *JAM ON* 0:38

#Angela   #Sidonianokishi   #knightsofsidonia   #animeop   #anime
I must marry her. It is my Destiny!
season 3 probably by winter, too many good animes coming out of japan 
lately, shingeki too mainstream now,
EVEN THE DOG IS SO FUCKING COOL
I swear if I had a country this song would be the anthem
Amo esta mierda,ese es mi aporte.
oh fuck yes thank you
Love it. Bought the music. Military Happy Hardcore Jpop?
JUST BY WATCHING THESE IN GOING TO WATCH THE SEASONS AGINE SO I CAN GET 
READY FOR SEASON 3 
EVEN THE GUY IN THE BACK IS COOL
LOVE EVERYTHING ABOUT THE SHOW THE SONG IT ALL SO COOOL!!!
I love this opening !!!!!
How brave this song is!
The 3rd season¥¥¥¥¥maybe ova.
Does anybody know wich flag is in this video?
I am listening to angela since i was very very young  I love it
