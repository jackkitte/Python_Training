ずっと光の中　昨日までは無かった　足跡を辿ってきたほど
ゴールの見えない迷路　雨に打たれた地図　後悔も何もないけど

叫んだ声は　
きっと届くから
この物語の始まる鐘の音が繋ぐ旅の途中で

君が描いた未来の世界は　いつかの空に導かれて
どんな夢重ねて偽る事のないあの光りを
ah on give for my way

もっと先に見える希望だけ残した　傷跡が癒える事はない
最低何か一つ手に入る物があったら　それだけで何もいらない

届けた空が
まだ孤独なら
この物語の終わりを告げる音聞かせて

そっとゆるやかに　立ち込める風
いつの日か終わる旅の途中で

君が描いた未来の世界は　今もどこかに生き続けて
本当の自分を受け入れてくれたあの光りを
ah on give for my way

どこまでも行こう　繋いだその手が　いつか離れそうでも
いつまでも信じてここで待つから　もう少しだけここにいて

君が描いた未来の世界は　いつかの空に導かれて
2つの想いを1つずつ形にして奇跡をもっと越えて
君が描いた未来の世界は　今もどこかで生き続けて
どんな夢重ねて偽る事のないあの光りを届けて
on give for my way';

yuuki!!!!! :(((((

ユウキ篇で過大評価されてる気がするわ。歌詞は良いが個人的にメロディはイントロ以外好きになれん。EDが全部持ってってる気がする。OPとしてはデスガン篇のが良い

ずっと光の中 
昨日までは無かった
足跡を辿ってきたほど
ゴールの見えない迷路
雨に打たれた地図
後悔も何もないけど

今もどこかに生き続けて
本当の自分を受け入れてくれたあの光りを
ah on give for my way

どこまでも行こう
繋いだその手が
いつか離れそうでも
いつまでも信じてここで待つから
もう少しだけここにいて

君が描いた未来の世界は
いつかの空に導かれて
２つの想いを１つずつ形にして奇跡をもっと越えて
君が描いた未来の世界は
今もどこかで生き続けて
どんな夢重ねて偽る事のないあの光りを届けて

The song just started and im almost in tears
この曲最高
When its 2020 or 2021, i'll go to japan, buy nerve gear, buy sao game, 
steal asuna from kirito. MISSION SUCCESS :D
Omg my opening favorite :) asuna yuuki <3
cheers for these songs mate keep up the good work on YouTube
Edit that annotation, now there's almost 10 Million
これ聞くと心が痛くなると同時に寂しくなるのと最高に興奮するの俺だけ？
anyone got a link to itunes cause I want to put this on a burnable CD and I 
don't like using the youtuber converter unless I have to so please itunes 
link!
my screen is Yuuki so i can remember my 2nd favorite character besides 
sinon
love this song
Remember watching this vid when it had 'just' 10k views...
now it are freeking 9 million views and counting. Time sure flies.
How come are there almost 10000000 views and 3000 comments but no one has 
mentioned that there's something on Yuuki's cheek
Best anima ever!
The feels man. So many.
Episodes 1-14 form S2 still the best. But the music is so good
Almost 10 Millions :D
I almost started crying
Yuuki ;(
SAO !! ;(
Good song
bad anime
I love this song, it is one my favorite songs from S.A.O.
I love this song, it is one of my favorite songs from S.A.O.
I remember I cried a lot 
Yuuki...
Don't Cry T_T
Yuki x Asuna...I (personally) ship it 
Shit season but awesome openings.
GOOd
SAO season 1 theme song plz
この曲を聴くといまだに泣けてくる……いい歌だ
Sword Art Online... Came for the fight, stayed for the story.. :')
I wish i had this much views ;(
Another great song from SAO 2, this is definably going on my song list with 
all the 100+ songs that I got. P.S. SAO is just as good as SAO 1.
I know that sao may get alot of hate but a massive amount of love too
but thats what I love about sao 
it isn't perfect it has flaws and that is what makes it good
yes it may have been rushed but they did the best they could and it still 
shined brightly as an awesome anime 

kirito and asunas romance was amazing slightly rushed and a tiny bitforced 
yes but 
it was done brilliantly and cleverly corrected 

yukki and asunas relationship was brillant just like sisters
and kirito and sinons relationship is just as good as yukki and asunas

yes there may be better animes out there but SAO too me is one of the very 
best 

screw the haters SAO FTW.
D:
やっぱSAOのOPの中で一番お気に入りかな(´∇｀)
now i'm crying again... Yuuki why can't they let a character be happy?! god 
dammit!
This song makes me cry every time because the minute we met Yuuki I fell in 
live now this just reminds me of her death which made me cry for hours. RIP 
Yuuki
ガチサイコー
this song make me remember about my past time.
darou?????
I'm glad this video wasn't blocked from the U.S. Yet.....fucking copyright 
sellout bullshit pisses me off the the 10th degree..like a burn you know.
who stan with asuna
Whenever I listen to any SAO intros, I get chills. RIPperoni Pepperoni to 
Yuuki-Chan
The Master BR...
If you are in need of a Senpai, I'm available!
both seasons were great. the art used for the vidoe makes me kinda sad and 
happy at the same time. btw do you guys see those little shards of light? 
does that mean their armor is breaking or that they are sitting on dying 
players/monsters?
After a year and a half I managed to finish the 3 last episodes after the 
series was spoiled for me.
I still cried for an hour and a half.
I used to have KLK as my fav anime but that's changing.
I feel like SAO II really got unjustly treated because of the name.
This arch, heck the entire SAO II season just trumps SAO completly, its 
much better in general and a really good series on its own.
Go yuki the leader of the gild of the black nights
I would like to see this song performed in English, great song and 
undoubtful it has great lyrics. For all American fans it would be great 
honor to hear it in English. I am looking froward to it.
the dislikers are probably members of laughing coffin.
lol
How the fuck does this song even have 8 million views? I ain't saying it is 
bad, but like the amount of hype surrounding this song shouldn't be 
anywhere near the first OP.
is the best.
I'm not understand to music because is a Japanese language!
I'm so sad!!!
I really love this <3 i wish SAO dont End :)
Awsome I like it
drains
Hum, by the way... today on my UTC location we are the 25/10/2015. 
Which means for the real planning freak who knows each and every single 
details of SAO by heart (like me) , that today is the day when Kirito and 
Asuna will moved on the 22 floor and buy their shark in the woods. Which 
means that this scene will happen in exactly 9 years from now on, on 
25/10/2024... 
The 20th was the fight with Heathcliff and the 24th was the scene where 
both of them were asking for a break from the front lines.

I'm crazy as fuck, I know...
:'( oh my... this song
YUUURIII
i love this anime!!! <3
asuna to yuki
watashi ga kiite saiko no uta to kore made

良い歌ですよね〜
戸松さんは歌が上手いと思います！
Soundtrack is epic
Damn the SAO songs were so high quality and the show was so bad.
listen to this give me so much energy to deal with school work
Do 1 hour or 10 hours of this music! It is so good! Pls ()
New Sword Art Online movie announced! REJOICE SAO fans!

Everything goes as expected. We will most likely get announcement of season 
3 at the end of this movie, just like season 2 was announced in Extra 
edition :)
cooll.....
Not the biggest Sword Art Online fan, but I found Yuuki and Asuna's story 
so touching. One of the most beautiful things I've seen in anime.
